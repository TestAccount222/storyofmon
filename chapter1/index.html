<center>In  the beginning, there was only Poing.
Poing was a being all powerful, and mighty, but one day, through  the endless stream of memes, he created life.
Life, was the first ever godly meme.
This godly meme, created beings that were able of their own thought, their own gesture and language.
But they were primitive; They were uneducated, they were nothing.
So Poing said "Let there be Susan Wojcicki."
Susan Wojcicki was a being almost as powerful as poing itself, and so she created the first realm; Youtube.
Youtube was a realm of intelligence, a realm of knowledge, but only select few would be able to gain enough knowledge to create what was called; Content.
The first ever content creators, were divine beings, Mon, Nate, Swager, And lando.
  And that's where it all started.</center>
